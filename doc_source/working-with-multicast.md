# Working with multicast<a name="working-with-multicast"></a>

You can configure multicast on transit gateways using the Amazon VPC console or the AWS CLI\. Note: Currently multicast on transit gateways is only available in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), Europe (Frankfurt), South America (SÃ£o Paulo), Middle East (Bahrain), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) and Asia Pacific (Seoul).

## Create a transit gateway multicast domain<a name="create-tgw-domain"></a>

To begin using multicast on a transit gateway, create a transit gateway multicast domain\.

Before you create a multicast domain, create a new transit gateway that has multicast enabled\. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway](tgw-transit-gateways.md#create-tgw)\.

**To create a transit gateway multicast domain using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateway Multicast**\.

1. Choose **Create Transit Gateway Multicast domain**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Name tag**, enter a name to identify the domain\.

1. For **Transit Gateway ID**, select the transit gateway that processes the multicast traffic\.

1. Choose **Create Transit Gateway Multicast Domain**\.

**To create a transit gateway multicast domain using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [create\-transit\-gateway\-multicast\-domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-transit-gateway-multicast-domain.html) command\.

## Associate VPC attachments and subnets with a transit gateway multicast domain<a name="associate-attachment-to-domain"></a>

Use the following procedure to associate a VPC attachment with a multicast domain\. When you create an association, you can then select the subnets to include in the multicast domain\. 

Before you begin, you must create a VPC attachment on your transit gateway\. For more information, see [Transit gateway attachments to a VPC](tgw-vpc-attachments.md)\.

**To associate VPC attachments with a transit gateway multicast domain using the console**
