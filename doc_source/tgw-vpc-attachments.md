# Transit gateway attachments to a VPC<a name="tgw-vpc-attachments"></a>

When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you must specify one subnet from each Availability Zone to be used by the transit gateway to route traffic\. Specifying one subnet from an Availability Zone enables traffic to reach resources in every subnet in that Availability Zone\.

**Limits**
+ When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, any resources in Availability Zones where there is no transit gateway attachment cannot reach the transit gateway\. If there is a route to the transit gateway in a subnet route table, traffic is forwarded to the transit gateway only when the transit gateway has an attachment in a subnet in the same Availability Zone\.
+ The resources in a VPC attached to a transit gateway cannot access the security groups of a different VPC that is also attached to the same transit gateway\.
+ A transit gateway does not support DNS resolution for custom DNS names of attached VPCs set up using private hosted zones in Amazon Route 53\. To configure name resolution for private hosted zones for all VPCs attached to a transit gateway, see [Centralized DNS management of hybrid cloud with Amazon Route 53 and AWS Transit Gateway](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/centralized-dns-management-of-hybrid-cloud-with-amazon-route-53-and-aws-transit-gateway/)\.
+ A transit gateway doesn't support routing between VPCs with identical CIDRs\. If you attach a VPC to a transit gateway and its CIDR is identical to the CIDR of another VPC that's already attached to the transit gateway, the routes for the newly attached VPC aren't propagated to the transit gateway route table\.
+ You can't create an attachment for a VPC subnet that resides in a Local Zone\. However, you can configure your network so that subnets in the Local Zone can connect to a transit gateway through the parent Availability Zone\. For more information, see [Connect Local Zone subnets to a transit gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Extend_VPCs.html#connect-local-zone-tgw)\.
+ You can't create a transit gateway attachment using IPv6\-only subnets\. Transit gateway attachment subnets must also support IPv4 addresses

## VPC attachment lifecycle<a name="vpc-attachment-lifecycle"></a>

A VPC attachment goes through various stages, starting when the request is initiated\. At each stage, there may be actions that you can take, and at the end of its lifecycle, the VPC attachment remains visible in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Console and in API or command line output, for a period of time\. 

The following diagram shows the states an attachment can go through in a single account configuration, or a cross\-account configuration that has **Auto accept shared attachments** turned on\.

![\[VPC attachment lifecycle\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/images/vpc-attachment-lifecycle.png)
+ **Pending**: A request for a VPC attachment has been initiated and is in the provisioning process\. At this stage, the attachment can fail, or can go to `available`\.
+ **Failing**: A request for a VPC attachment is failing\. At this stage, the VPC attachment goes to `failed`\.
+ **Failed**: The request for the VPC attachment has failed\. While in this state, it cannot be deleted\. The failed VPC attachment remains visible for 2 hours, and then is no longer visible\.
+ **Available**: The VPC attachment is available, and traffic can flow between the VPC and the transit gateway\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `modifying`, or go to `deleting`\.
+ **Deleting**: A VPC attachment that is in the process of being deleted\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `deleted`\.
+ **Deleted**: An `available` VPC attachment has been deleted\. While in this state, the VPC attachment cannot be modified\. The VPC attachment remains visible for 2 hours, and then is no longer visible\.
+ **Modifying**: A request has been made to modify the properties of the VPC attachment\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `available`, or go to `rolling back`\.
+ **Rolling back**: The VPC attachment modification request cannot be completed, and the system is undoing any changes that were made\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `available`\.

The following diagram shows the states an attachment can go through in a cross\-account configuration that has **Auto accept shared attachments** turned off\.

![\[Cross-account VPC attachment lifecycle that has Auto accept shared attachments turned off\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/images/vpc-attachment-lifecycle-cross-account.png)
+ **Pending\-acceptance**: The VPC attachment request is awaiting acceptance\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `pending`, to `rejecting`, or to `deleting`\.
+ **Rejecting**: A VPC attachment that is in the process of being rejected\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `rejected`\.
+ **Rejected**: A `pending acceptance` VPC attachment has been rejected\. While in this state, the VPC attachment cannot be modified\. The VPC attachment remains visible for 2 hours, and then is no longer visible\.
+ **Pending**: The VPC attachment has been accepted and is in the provisioning process\. At this stage, the attachment can fail, or can go to `available`\.
+ **Failing**: A request for a VPC attachment is failing\. At this stage, the VPC attachment goes to `failed`\.
+ **Failed**: The request for the VPC attachment has failed\. While in this state, it cannot be deleted\. The failed VPC attachment remains visible for 2 hours, and then is no longer visible\.
+ **Available**: The VPC attachment is available, and traffic can flow between the VPC and the transit gateway\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `modifying`, or go to `deleting`\.
+ **Deleting**: A VPC attachment that is in the process of being deleted\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `deleted`\.
+ **Deleted**: An `available` or `pending acceptance` VPC attachment has been deleted\. While in this state, the VPC attachment cannot be modified\. The VPC attachment remains visible 2 hours, and then is no longer visible\.
+ **Modifying**: A request has been made to modify the properties of the VPC attachment\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `available`, or go to `rolling back`\.
+ **Rolling back**: The VPC attachment modification request cannot be completed, and the system is undoing any changes that were made\. At this stage, the attachment can go to `available`\.

## Troubleshoot VPC attachment creation<a name="transit-gateway-vpc-attch-troubleshooting"></a>

The following topic can help you troubleshoot problems that you might have when you create a VPC attachment\.

**Problem**  
The VPC attachment failed\. 

**Cause**  
The cause might be one of the following:

1. The user that is creating the VPC attachment does not have correct permissions to create service\-linked role\.

1. There is a throttling issue because of too many IAM requests, for example you are using AWS CloudFormation to create permissions and roles\.

1. The account has the service\-linked role, and the service\-linked role has been modified\.

1. The transit gateway is not in the `available` state\.

**Solution**  
Depending on the cause, try the following:

1. Verify that the user has the correct permissions to create service\-linked roles\. For more information, see [Service\-linked role permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*\. After the user has the permissions, create the VPC attachment\.

1. Create the VPC attachment manually through the console or API\. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPC](#create-vpc-attachment)\.

1. Verify that the service\-linked role has the correct permissions\. For more information, see [Transit gateway service\-linked role](service-linked-roles.md#tgw-service-linked-roles)\.

1. Verify that the transit gateway is in the `available` state\. For more information, see [View your transit gateways](tgw-transit-gateways.md#view-tgws)\.
