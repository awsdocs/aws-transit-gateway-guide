# Transit gateway sharing considerations<a name="transit-gateway-share"></a>

You can use AWS Resource Access Manager \(RAM\) to share a transit gateway for VPC attachments across accounts or across your organization in AWS Organizations\. Take the following into account when you want to share a transit gateway\.

An AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN attachment must be created in the same AWS account that owns the transit gateway\.

An attachment to a Direct Connect gateway uses a transit gateway association and can be in the same AWS account as the Direct Connect gateway, or a different one from the Direct Connect gateway\.

By default, IAM users do not have permission to create or modify AWS RAM resources\. To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and perform tasks, you must create IAM policies that grant permission to use specific resources and API actions\. You then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions\. 

Only the resource owner can perform the following operations:
+ Create a resource share\.
+ Update a resource share\.
+ View a resource share\.
+ View the resources that are shared by your account, across all resource shares\.
+ View the principals with whom you are sharing your resources, across all resource shares\. Viewing the principals with whom you are sharing enables you to determine who has access to your shared resources\.
+ Delete a resource share\.
+ Run all transit gateway, transit gateway attachment, and transit gateway route tables APIs\.

You can perform the following operations on resources that are shared with you:
+ Accept, or reject a resource share invitation\.
+ View a resource share\.
+ View the shared resources that you can access\.
+ View a list of all the principals that are sharing resources with you\. You can see which resources and resource shares they have shared with you\.
+ Can run the `DescribeTransitGateways` API\.
+ Run the APIs that create and describe attachments, for example `CreateTransitGatewayVpcAttachment` and `DescribeTransitGatewayVpcAttachments`, in their VPCs\.
+ Leave a resource share\.

When a transit gateway is shared with you, you cannot create, modify, or delete its transit gateway route tables, or its transit gateway route table propagations and associations\.

When you create a transit gateway, the transit gateway, is created in the Availability Zone that is mapped to your account and is independent from other accounts\. When the transit gateway and the attachment entities are in different accounts, use the Availability Zone ID to uniquely and consistently identify the Availability Zone\. For example, use1\-az1 is an AZ ID for the us\-east\-1 Region and maps to the same location in every AWS account\. 

## Unshare a transit gateway<a name="transit-gateway-unshare"></a>

When the share owner unshares the transit gateway, the following rules apply:
+ The transit gateway attachment remains functional\.
+ The shared account can not describe the transit gateway\.
+ The transit gateway owner, and the share owner can delete the transit gateway attachment\.
