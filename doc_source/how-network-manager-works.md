# How Transit Gateway Network Manager works<a name="how-network-manager-works"></a>

To use Transit Gateway Network Manager \(Network Manager\), you create a *global network* to represent your network\. Initially, the global network is empty\. You then register your existing transit gateways and define your on\-premises resources in the global network\. This enables you to visualize and monitor your AWS resources and your on\-premises networks\.

After you create your global network, you can monitor your networks through a dashboard on the Network Manager console\. You can view network activity and health using Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon CloudWatch Events\. The Network Manager console can help you identify whether issues in your network are caused by AWS resources, your on\-premises resources, or the connections between them\.

Network Manager does not create, modify, or delete your transit gateways and their attachments\. To work with transit gateways, use the Amazon VPC console and the Amazon EC2 APIs\.

## Registering transit gateways<a name="nm-how-it-works-tgws"></a>

You can register transit gateways that are in the same AWS account as your global network\. When you register a transit gateway, the following transit gateway attachments are automatically included in your global network:
+ VPCs
+ Site\-to\-Site VPN connections
+ AWS Direct Connect gateways
+ Transit gateway peering connections

When you register a transit gateway that has a peering attachment, you can view the peer transit gateway in your global network, but you cannot view its attachments\. If you own the peer transit gateway, you can register it in your global network to view its attachments\. 

If you delete a transit gateway, it's automatically deregistered from your global network\.

### Multi\-region network<a name="multi-region-tgw"></a>

You can create a global network that includes transit gateways in multiple AWS Regions\. This enables you to monitor the global health of your AWS network\. In the following diagram, the global network includes a transit gateway in the `us-east-2` Region and a transit gateway in the `us-west-2` Region\. Each transit gateway has VPC and VPN attachments\. You can use the Network Manager console to view and monitor both of the transit gateways and their attachments\.

## Defining and associating your on\-premises network<a name="nm-how-it-works-on-premises"></a>

To represent your on\-premises network, you add *devices*, *links*, and *sites* to your global network\. A site represents the physical location of your branch, office, store, campus, data center, and so on\. When you add a site, you can specify the location information, including the physical address and coordinates\.

A device represents the physical or virtual appliance that establishes connectivity with a transit gateway over an IPsec VPN tunnel\. A link represents a single outbound internet connection used by a device, for example, a 20 Mbps broadband link\.

When you create a device, you can specify its physical location, and the site where it's located\. A device can have a more specific location than the site, for example, a building in a campus or a floor in a building\. When you create a link, you create it for a specific site\. You can then associate a device with a link\. 

To connect your on\-premises network to your AWS resources, associate a customer gateway that's in your global network with the device\. In the following diagram, the on\-premises network is connected to a transit gateway through a Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\.

![\[On-premises network\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/images/nm-single-device-single-vpn.png)

You can have multiple devices in a site, and you can associate a device with multiple links\. For examples, see [Scenarios for Transit Gateway Network Manager](network-manager-scenarios.md)\.

You can work with one of our Partners in the AWS Partner Network \(APN\) to provision and connect your on\-premises networks\. For more information, see [AWS Partner Network \(APN\)](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/)\.

## Network Manager quotas<a name="network-manager-limits"></a>

Your AWS account has the following quotas related to Network Manager:
+ Global networks per AWS account: 5
+ Devices per global network: 200
+ Links per global network: 200
+ Sites per global network: 200

The Service Quotas console provides information about Network Manager quotas\. You can use the Service Quotas console to view default quotas and [request quota increases](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?) for adjustable quotas\.

For more information about Site\-to\-Site VPN quotas, see [Site\-to\-Site VPN Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-limits.html) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\.
