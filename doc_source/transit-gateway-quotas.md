# Quotas for your transit gateways<a name="transit-gateway-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has the following service quotas \(previously referred to as *limits*\) related to transit gateways\. Unless indicated otherwise, you can [request an increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=vpc) for a quota\. For more information about service quotas, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

## General<a name="general-quota"></a>
+ Number of transit gateways per Region per account: 5

## Routing<a name="general-quota"></a>
+ Number of transit gateway route tables per transit gateway: 20
+ Number of routes per transit gateway: 10,000

  For VPC route table quotas, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## Transit gateway attachments<a name="attachments-quota"></a>
+ Total number of transit gateway attachments per transit gateway: 5,000
+ Number of transit gateway attachments per VPC: 5

  This value cannot be increased\.
+ Number of transit gateway peering attachments per transit gateway: 50
+ Number of pending transit gateway peering attachments transit gateway:10

## Bandwidth<a name="bandwidth-quota"></a>
+ Maximum bandwidth \(burst\) per VPC connection: 50 Gbps
+ Maximum bandwidth per VPN tunnel: 1\.25 Gbps

  This is a hard value\. You can use ECMP to get higher VPN bandwidth by aggregating multiple VPN tunnels\.

## AWS Direct Connect gateways<a name="direct-connect-quota"></a>
+ Number of AWS Direct Connect gateways per transit gateway: 20

  This value cannot be increased\.
+ Transit gateways per AWS Direct Connect gateway: 3

  This value cannot be increased\.

## MTU<a name="mtu-quota"></a>
+  The maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) of a network connection is the size, in bytes, of the largest permissible packet that can be passed over the connection\. The larger the MTU of a connection, the more data can be passed in a single packet\. A transit gateway supports an MTU of 8500 bytes for traffic between VPCs, Direct Connect and peering attachments\. Traffic over VPN connections can have an MTU of 1500 bytes\. 
+ Packets with a size larger than 8500 bytes which arrive at the transit gateway are dropped\.
+ The transit gateway does not generate the FRAG\_NEEDEDICMP packet, so Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is not supported\.
+ The transit gateway enforces [maximum segment size (MSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_segment_size) clamping for all packets\.

## Multicast<a name="multicast-quota"></a>
+ Number of multicast domains per transit gateway: 20
+ Number of multicast group members and sources per transit gateway: 1000
+ Number of members per transit gateway multicast group: 100
+ Number of multicast domain associations per VPC: 20
+ Number of sources per transit gateway multicast group: 1
